{% comment %} The krishna tilak is named as Gaudiya Tilak and has two parts, the u bend and a diamond like figure conjoined to it.
The U bed symbolizes lorf krishna's feet. and the siamond shape figure is literally the tulsi leaf. 

Dharma has no synonym or even antonym in any language, the words only belongs to devanagari. It only means kartavya palan or Best Practices, in any situation, doing what is right not needful, right, is dharma.
